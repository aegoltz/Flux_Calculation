# Flux_Calculation

# This repository is associated with the submission by Goltz, A.E.; Till, C.B.; and Kent, A.J.R. entitled "Steady, as she goes: Steady-state subduction parameters account for high magmatic fluxes during continental flare-ups"

To use, download all files (.Rmd is an R-Notebook, which will allow you to run code in chunks). You will also need to download RStudio, which is free and open source (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/); typical install time is on the order of minutes. The Excel sheets will enable you to plot figure 2 from the main text and all three supplementary figures. Put all files in a single directory, and open the .Rmd file. Detailed instructions on running the code are within the .Rmd file. You should now be able to reproduce our calculations and figures. The Rmd file is heavily annotated, but please feel free to reach out with questions.

To view code in a more "reader friendly" output, download and open Flux_Notebook_knit.nb.html, which will open a formatted version of the code found in the .Rmd file with embedded chunks of code, much like a notebook, in your computer browser.

This code was tested on a Macintosh with an M1 chip (OS Monterey, version 12.4) using R version 3.6.1 ("Action of the Toes"), but with proper installation of RStudio, this code should run on any device. The runtime of the main code on this machine with 100k iterations is about a half hour.
