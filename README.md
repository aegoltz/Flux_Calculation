# This repository is associated with the submission by Goltz, A.E.; Till, C.B.; and Kent, A.J.R. entitled "Systematic Underestimation of Magmatic Flux at Arcs"

To use, download all files (.Rmd is an R-Notebook, which will allow you to run code in chunks). The Excel sheets will enable you to plot figure 1 from the main text. Put all files in your directory, and open the .Rmd file. You should now be able to reproduce our calculations and figures.
To view code in a more "reader friendly" output, download and open Flux_Notebook_knit.nb.html, which will open a formatted version of the code found in the .Rmd file with embedded chunks of code, much like a notebook.
