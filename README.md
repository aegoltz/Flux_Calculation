# Flux_Calculation

# This repository is associated with the submission by Goltz, A.E.; Till, C.B.; and Kent, A.J.R. entitled "Systematic Underestimation of Magmatic Flux at Arcs"

To use, download all files (.Rmd is an R-Notebook, which will allow you to run code in chunks). You will also need to download RStudio, which is free and open source (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). The Excel sheets will enable you to plot figure 1 from the main text. Put all files in a single directory, and open the .Rmd file. You should now be able to reproduce our calculations and figures. The Rmd file is heavily annotated, but please feel free to reach out with questions.

To view code in a more "reader friendly" output, download and open Flux_Notebook_knit.nb.html, which will open a formatted version of the code found in the .Rmd file with embedded chunks of code, much like a notebook.
